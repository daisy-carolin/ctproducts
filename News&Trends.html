   <h3>Topic of the Month April 2022 : <br>Telemedicine as an alternative: <br>contactless and secure diagnoses</h3>
   <img  width="200" height="250"    src="./images/news1.jpg">
   <P>
    Concrete diagnoses are the be-all and end-all
     in<br> medicine. However, the Corona pandemic 
     made <br> conditions for good diagnostics 
     more difficult. <br> offers an 
     alternative - not only in times of pandemic.<br>
      For this, however, it is necessary to exploit
       the <br>full potential of technical possibilities.

    In order <br>to offer an experience equivalent to a
     physical <br>visit to the doctor, the applications
      must go<br> beyond mere consultations. In addition
       to robotic<br> examination systems, artificial 
       intelligence can<br> also make an important
        contribution to symptom<br> recognition.
    
    Telemedicine: Safe diagnostics in the <br>pandemic - and beyond
    
    Who could have foreseen <br>how the Corona pandemic 
    would transform our <br>lives? The work world has 
    been transformed by <br>mobile working and digital 
    tools. Face-to-face<br> meetings still matter, but
     they are not quite as <br>important asthey used 
     to be. And telemedicine is <br>changing how 
     physicians interact with patients.

<h3>AI and Robotics Uncover Cellular Hallmarks <br>of Parkinson’s in Skin Cells</h3>
<img  width="200" height="250"    src="images/news2.jpg">

<P>Researchers at the New York Stem Cell Foundation<br> Research 
  Institute have unveiled a new platform for<br> discovering cellular 
  signatures of disease, which<br> integrates robotic 
  systems for studying patient cells<br> with artificial 
  intelligence methods for image analysis.<br>

  Using their automated cell culture platform, the <br>scientists
   collaborated with Google Research<br> to successfully identify 
   new cellular hallmarks of<br> Parkinson’s disease by creating and
    profiling over <br>a million images of skin cells from a cohort
     of 91<br> patients and healthy controls.
  
  “Traditional drug <br>discovery isn’t working very well,
   particularly for <br>complex diseases like Parkinson’s,” noted 
   NYSCF <br>CEO Susan L. Solomon, JD. “The robotic technology<br> NYSCF
    has built allows us to generate vast amounts<br> of data from large 
    populations of patients, and discover<br> new signatures of disease 
    as an entirely new basis for,<br> discovering drugs that actually work.”
  
  Marc Berndl,<br> Software Engineer at Google Research, added,
   “This <br>is an ideal demonstration of the power of artificial<br>
   intelligence for disease research. We have had a very <br>productive
    collaboration with NYSCF, especially<br> because their advanced
     robotic systems create <br>reproducible data that can yield reliable insights.”

<h3>Wearable Surgical Lighting System</h3>
<img  width="200" height="250"    src="images/news3.jpg">
<p>At critical care facilities that handle tertiary care, there are many situations 
  in which surgery is performed right in the ER（Fig.1）. Our hospital has a normal
   ceiling-mounted surgical light with 2 arms in the ER, yet when performing 
   emergency thoracotomy for instance in cases such as rib fracture in the 
   thoracic cavity, liver injury below the diaphragm, spleen injury or
    retroperitoneal bleeding during open surgery, the light does not
     sufficiently reach deep into the surgical field. And during 
     hemostatic suture, it becomes increasingly difficult to stop 
     the bleeding in one attempt without sufficient illumination 
     for clear visibility. For this reason, I have always wanted 
     a surgical light that can illuminate deep cavities while
      controlling shadows from forming. In severe trauma cases where 
      patient’s vital signs are unfavorable yet no time to examine 
      thoroughly by CT scan, it is not uncommon to begin surgery without
       clear knowledge of which organ is damaged. In order to identify the affected area, 
  the surgeon and the assistant will examine by moving their posture around to get a visual confirmation.

<h3>Cedars-Sinai – Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion</h3>
<img   width="200" height="250"    src="images/news4.jpg">
<p>CO Architects was commissioned to design an advanced<br> technology
   surgical suite at the Cedars-Sinai Advanced <br>Health Sciences Pavilion in Los Angeles, California.<br>

  At the completion of the AHSP, the Level 4 shell space <br>was 
  prepared to accommodate eight ORs, two Cath labs, <br>and two Interventional
  Radiology (IR) rooms. In preparation<br> of the build out of Level 4,
   Cedars‐Sinai programmed the<br> shell space to accommodate a greater
    demand, which included<br> more ORs in the same amount of space. In
     the process of<br> designing the floor to meet the requirements of 
     the new <br>program, CO Architects applied principles of lean operations<br>
      to healthcare to determine the placement of the ORs, and<br> support spaces, and to right‐size the operating
   rooms.<br> The new surgical suite contains 13 operating rooms, <br>16 pre‐op stations, 17 post‐anesthesia care unit (PACU) stations.

  <h3>World Kidney Day 2022: Kidney health for all</h3>
  <img  width="200" height="250"    src="images/news5.jpg">
  <p>
    World Kidney Day takes place every year on the second <br>Thursday
     in March, which this year is March 10. The<br> theme for 2022 has
      been set by the World Kidney Day<br> Joint Steering Committee as
       "Kidney health for all".<br> The committee is
     calling for a concerted effort to <br>address the knowledge gaps 
     around kidney care.<br>

    The kidneys' functions include filtering harmful <br>substances
     from the blood and draining excess fluid <br>from the body. 
     However, in an estimated one in ten adults, <br>these functions
      are impaired, and they have some form<br> of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
    
    Most often, elevated <br>blood pressure and advanced diabetes 
    are the cause of <br>damage to the kidneys. These cannot be
     reversed. However,<br> if CKD is detected in time, its progression 
     can be slowed<br> or even stopped.
    
    Its progress is divided into five stages,<br> depending on the
     extent of functional impairment. Stage<br> 5 is called chronic 
     kidney failure - the kidneys can then no<br> longer perform their
      functions. People with chronic kidney<br> failure require kidney 
      replacement therapy, either dialysis <br>or a transplant.

    <h3>Clear aligners: The star of 2021</h3>
    <img  width="200" height="250"    src="images/news6.jpg">
    <p>
      LEIPZIG, Germany: Last year, clear aligner therapy provided dentists 
      around the world with an attractive income stream even as patient 
      volumes remained sluggish. Indeed, major dental companies increased
       investment in their clear aligner portfolios during the year and 
       some did so while divesting other parts of their businesses.

      Record case shipments were recorded, and the continued development
       of clear aligner therapy supported the maturing and further adoption
        of digital workflows and spurred new innovations in treatment
         planning. It is therefore fair to say that clear aligners did
          more than simply straightening of teeth in dentistry in 2021.
      
      Dental markets proved their resilience in 2021, and clear aligners
       helped them to virtually claw themselves back to pre-pandemic levels
        of sales and oral care provision. If we consider the newest and
         most cutting-edge areas of dentistry—such as fully digital workflows
          and 3D printing—we find clear aligner therapy at centre stage. 
          For example, a recent study led by researchers at Semmelweis University 
          in Budapest found that the field of orthodontics accounted for the 
          second most common use of 3D printers in dental settings. Dental 
          manufacturers churned out more software updates during the year that
           further integrated intra-oral scanners and clear aligner systems into orthodontic practice, and the popularity of clear aligners helped to achieve a broader acceptance of teledentistry among
       consumers, insurance providers, and dental boards and associations.
